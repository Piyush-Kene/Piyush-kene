## Day 44 - Done ✅

- At first I run following commands  - <img width="698" height="498" alt="Screenshot 2026-02-11 235213" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d90d0d8b-cad7-44b5-8651-5ed86b867942" />
- In this command I found that the /etc/shadow file can be readable.

- then I run john ripper tool and it get complete but it may be failed and show zero password hashed (I tried few times with some modulations but can't get success)

- So I will try this task again and maybe solve it.
