- And I also install **Zenmap** software for port scanning and Performed an Nmap scan to understand host discovery and port scanning.
- It Analyzed scan results to identify host availability, port states, and firewall behavior.

### And I find this Observations:-
- The target host was **reachable and online**.
- No open ports were found.
- Most ports were **filtered**, indicating the presence of a firewall.
- The device behaved like a **network security gateway** rather than a regular server.

### What I learned
- How to read and interpret an Nmap scan report.
- Difference between **open**, **closed**, and **filtered** ports.
- How firewalls affect scan results and OS detection.

### NOTE -  I use chatgpt for understand this zenmap report and I don't upload the screenshot of it as it suggested by chatgpt and I may consider sharing it later after gaining a deeper and clearer understanding of the report.
