## Day 40 - Done ✅
- **Practical & Theory (TryHackMe & Roadmap.sh)**: -Today I learn about NFC(Near field communication) - It's core concept, features and how it works.
- And for practical I start Hydra room on tryhackme and complete it's intro but while running command I get stuck so I will retry it tommorow.
